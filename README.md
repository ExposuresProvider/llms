# llms
This repository is intended to serve as a workspace for projects related to Large Language Models (LLMs). In particular, the repository will support application of LLMs to ICEES (ICEES+ and icees-kg), cam-kp, and the Translator system. Of note, the LLM work is one of our Translator Y5 milestones.

**Exposures Provider - Translator Y5 LLM Milestone**

SA1d. Working with the soon-to-be-formed Translator Generative AI Task Force, develop approaches for leveraging LLMs in support of ICEES+ and ICEES KG KP, focusing initially on approaches for applying LLMs to translate user natural-language questions into ICEES+ multivariate queries and ICEES KG TRAPI queries.
