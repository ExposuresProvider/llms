**Exposures Provider - Translator Y5 LLM Milestone**

SA1d. Working with the soon-to-be-formed Translator Generative AI Task Force, develop approaches for leveraging LLMs in support of ICEES+ and ICEES KG KP, focusing initially on approaches for applying LLMs to translate user natural-language questions into ICEES+ multivariate queries and ICEES KG TRAPI queries.
